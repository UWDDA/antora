Lambda +
Pros +

Serverless +

Scales with demand +

Cons +

Timeout after 900s +

Lack of portability +

Can be called from virtually any AWS service Requires AWS Architecture +

Can run container images +

Works great on short tasks +

Costs +

Conversion.sh +

Can’t be tested locally +

Limit of tens of thousands concurrent runs +

Not suited for long-running tasks +

Function-level offers less control +

Constants: +
Memory of 128 MB is used (minimum for AWS Lambda) +
Assume lambda is run 10,000,000 times a month +
The monthly compute price is $0.00001667 per GBs +
conversion.sh takes an average of 0.52s when run with 128 MB +

Conversion +

Pros +

Scalability +

Cons +

Pay for uptime of EC2 instances +

On-Demand scalability +

Potentially costly depending on EC2 plan +

Control over # of instances and tasks +

Can host and upkeep services +

Can run container images +

Automatically scales +

Easy to setup + maintain +
