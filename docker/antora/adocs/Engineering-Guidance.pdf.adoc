Tasks +

Below is an example of a process in which you can follow to achieve
sound documentation or repeatable engineering efforts. +

Task: Primary Objective: Deploy System +

Subtasks: +

Investigation +

Acceptance: +

Identifying the purpose of the system +
Identifying documentation for the system +
Identify the baseline requirements for the system to be operational +
Identified the point of contact for the system +

Planning: Designs & Architecture +

Acceptance: +

Dependencies (i.e. Lambda, EC2, S3, ElasticSearch, etc) +

Are derived from: +

Identify the baseline requirements +
Identifying documentation for the system +
Expected Deployment Environment +

Overall Architecture Document +

Network Data Flow Map (SV-1) +
Process Control Flow (What triggers what) +

Approval +

Pseudo Tests +

Acceptance: +

i.e. Write tests in a pseudo format that explains what needs to be
validated +

Validate that a user can login with username and password +
Validate that the web site loads when visiting the domain name +
Validate that the dependencies are available to be used in
implementation +
Validate necessary certificates are obtained for implementation +
Validate certificate authentication +
Validate group membership management +

Peer Review: Design Review (Approval) +

Sit with peer and review the designs and architecture +

Acceptance: +

Approval on the Design collectively as a team or delegated approval
peers +

Implementation +

Acceptance: +

Make sure all pseudo tests are implemented on a technical level +
System is functioning and operational +
Deployment/implementation documentation created independent of the code
written +

Write Unit Tests +

Write the tests in the chosen testing framework of the team that will be
executed on every deployment +
These are based on the pseudo tests written during the test phase +

Implementation Review +

This effort involves another engineer reviewing the implementation
process to ensure that there was not anything +
overlooked based on the documentation to deploy that you created during
the implementation phase. +

Obtain approval to deploy to a production environment +

The system is publicly accessible for the users you defined +
